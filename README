here lies some python nonsense to allow folks on the #acemonstertoys channel
of freenode to display stuff on the LED sign hanging up at ace monster toys irl.

this stuff needs Joel Rosdahl's LGPL'd ircbot.py that you can get from here:
http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/

for a bunch of links and infomation about the LED sign and this project,
